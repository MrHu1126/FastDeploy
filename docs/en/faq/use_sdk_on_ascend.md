# # Linux deployment with C++ on Huawei Ascend

After the deployment example is compiled, we need to import some environment variables to initialize the deployment environment before running the program, because we need to use the Huawei Ascend toolkit.
Users can use the following script (located in the directory of the compiled FastDeploy library) to initialize the Huawei Ascend deployment environment.


```
# The path to our default Ascend Toolkit is as follows,
# HUAWEI_ASCEND_TOOLKIT_HOME="/usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest"
# HUAWEI_ASCEND_DRIVER_PATH="/usr/local/Ascend/driver"
# If the user's installation directory is different from this, you need to export it manually first.
# export HUAWEI_ASCEND_TOOLKIT_HOME="Your_ascend_toolkit_path"
# export HUAWEI_ASCEND_DRIVER_PATH="Your_ascend_driver_path"

source fastdeploy-ascend/fastdeploy_init.sh
```

Note that this command only takes effect in the current command environment after execution (switching to a new terminal window, or closing the window and reopening it will not work), if you need to keep it in effect on the system, add these environment variables to the `~/.bashrc` file.

# Enable FlyCV for Ascend deployment

[FlyCV](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/FlyCV) is a high performance computer image processing library, providing better performance than other image processing libraries, especially in the ARM architecture.
FastDeploy is now integrated with FlyCV, allowing users to use FlyCV on supported hardware platforms to accelerate model end-to-end inference performance.

In end-to-end model inference, the pre-processing and post-processing phases are CPU computation, we recommend using FlyCV for end-to-end inference performance acceleration when you are using ARM CPU + Ascend hardware platform. See the following documentation for details.
